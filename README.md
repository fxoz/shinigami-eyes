# Shinigami Eyes

Inspired by the _Death Note_ series, this project primarily serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of "pure" CSS & JavaScript without any libraries and with no SVG, Canvas or WebGL.

Simply put, in the series, the Shinigami Eyes allow the user to see the name and remaining lifespan of any person by looking at them. This project is a recreation of that effect.

A clip of the series which features the Shinigami Eyes can be found [here](https://youtu.be/hrJpO1o38Zs?t=37). Click [here](https://deathnote.fandom.com/wiki/Shinigami_Eyes) to learn more about the lore about it.

Furthermore, the website is rendered client-side with no server-side processing necessary. At the time of writing this readme, all code was written by me, Felix Orosz.

The animation took me 4 hours to create, and the customization options as well as the rest of the website took me additional 5 hours.

## Features & Capabilities

- Vastly customizable
- Compatible with the screen recorder [OBS](https://obsproject.com), including the ability to make the background transparent
- No server-side processing
- No external libraries
- No SVG, Canvas or WebGL

## Limitations

Because of my choice to not use SVG, Canvas or WebGL, the animation is not as smooth and accurate as it could be. Thus, the following limitations apply:

- No distortion or motion blur effect
- Performance may vary depending on the device
- High settings & effects may cause stuttering
